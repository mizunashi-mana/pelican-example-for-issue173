The below line is redundant.

.. code-block:: python

  a = 0
  b = 0
  very_long_long_long_long_var = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 # this is very very very long long long line example.

This is a normal content to see the line wrapping problem. The above code block is generated by reStructuredText code-block directive. `code-block directive <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.8/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-code-block>`_ is in general use by sphinx users and supported pelican without any extensions. This issue is critical on mobile. And, no highlight contents are well::

  a = 0
  b = 0
  very_long_long_long_long_var = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 # this is very very very long long long line example.
